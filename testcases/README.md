# Test Cases
Every folder in here should, when linted, produce the output seen in `output.txt`.
They should also produce the exit code in `exitcode.txt`, if it's specified.

Since order can vary by which files are parsed first, test output and `output.txt` is sorted alphabetically.

Folders may also contain a `ziglint.json` specifying config.
